## Technical Details

### Docker Images
- **App:** Node 22-slim, multi-stage build with standalone output
- **Worker:** Node 22-slim with procps for health checks
- **Database:** pgvector/pgvector:pg17
- **Storage:** minio/minio:latest

### Build Optimizations
- Multi-stage builds for minimal image sizes
- Environment validation skipped during build (`SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true`)
- All dependencies cached for faster rebuilds
- Health checks configured for all services

### Data Persistence
- PostgreSQL data: `postgres_data` volume
- MinIO data: `minio_data` volume
- Migrations: Applied and tracked in database

## Next Steps

### For Production Deployment

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Change default passwords in `.env.production`
   - Add your Google AI API key (for cloud LLM operations)
   - Set proper `NEXTAUTH_URL` for your domain

2. **Setup SSL/HTTPS**
   - Follow instructions in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
   - Enable nginx service with production profile

3. **Configure Backups**
   - Set up automated database backups (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - Schedule daily backups via cron
   - Test restore procedure

4. **Monitoring**
   - Health endpoint is ready for monitoring tools
   - Consider adding Grafana/Prometheus
   - Set up log aggregation

### For Development

To stop the production environment and return to dev:

```bash
# Stop and remove containers (keeps data)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Stop and remove containers + data
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down -v

# Return to dev environment
docker compose up -d
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

```bash
# Check service logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Check specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs app
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs worker

# Restart a service
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart app

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
