# Phase 2: Personalization & Scoring - Completion Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Timeline**: Week 3 (Serial Development Roadmap)
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Ingestion & Enrichment) ✅ Complete
**Completion Date**: October 19, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 successfully implemented the personalization and ranking engine that transforms unranked paper feeds into relevance-scored, user-specific recommendations. Papers are now scored using a sophisticated multi-signal algorithm, filtered by personalization rules, and continuously refined through feedback-driven vector learning.

**Key Achievement**: Full personalization pipeline from scored papers → ranked recommendations with comprehensive test coverage (221 total tests passing, 127 new tests added in Phase 2).

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Vector Learning via Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

**Decision**: Use EMA with conservative weight (90% old, 10% new)

**Rationale**:
- Prevents rapid drift from user's true preferences
- Allows gradual convergence over many feedback actions
- Mathematically simple and interpretable
- Proven effective in recommender systems

### 2. Velocity Signal Placeholder

**Decision**: Return 0.5 for all papers in Phase 2, defer full implementation to Phase 7

**Rationale**:
- Velocity requires daily topic tracking infrastructure (Phase 7)
- 10% weight means low impact on final scores (0.05 range)
- Placeholder prevents blocking Phase 2 progress
- Can be fully implemented when trending infrastructure ready

### 3. Hard Filtering for Exclusion Rules

**Decision**: Excluded topics/keywords completely remove papers from results (not scored)

**Rationale**:
- User intention is clear: "I never want to see this"
- Scoring excluded papers wastes computation
- Simpler UX: excluded papers truly disappear
- Matches user mental model

### 4. Lab Prior as Placeholder

**Decision**: Implement logic but wait for affiliation data to fully activate

**Rationale**:
- arXiv API doesn't provide structured affiliation data
- Requires external data source (e.g., Semantic Scholar, author name → lab mapping)
- Code ready, just needs data
- 10% weight means low immediate impact

### 5. Score Breakdown Storage

**Decision**: Store all 6 component signals in Score table

**Rationale**:
- Enables "Why Shown" explanations without recomputation
- Useful for debugging and tuning weights
- Minimal storage overhead (6 floats per score)
- Critical for transparency and user trust

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Phase 2 Limitations

1. **Velocity Signal (V)**: Placeholder returning 0.5
   - Full implementation in Phase 7 (Trends & Analytics)

2. **Lab Prior (L)**: Awaiting affiliation data
   - Logic implemented, needs external data source
   - Options: Semantic Scholar API, Papers with Code, manual curation

3. **No Re-Ranking on Feedback**: Profile updates don't immediately re-score papers
   - Scores remain cached until next scheduled re-ranking
   - Acceptable for Phase 2, can optimize in Phase 3+

4. **LOF (Local Outlier Factor) for Novelty**: Deferred as optional
   - Centroid distance + novel keywords sufficient for now
   - Can add if needed for better novelty detection

5. **No Scheduled Re-Scoring**: Papers scored once, not re-scored daily
   - Can add pg-boss job for daily re-scoring in Phase 3+

### Technical Debt

**From Code Review** (October 19, 2025):
1. **Feedback Router Refactoring** (Priority: Medium)
   - Extract common `handleFeedback()` function
   - Reduces ~170 lines to ~40 lines
   - Improves maintainability
   - Tracked for Phase 3 polish

2. **Authentication Implementation** (Priority: High)
   - Multi-user support with Auth.js v5
   - Protected procedures in tRPC
   - Session management
   - Tracked for Phase 3

3. **UI Error Handling** (Priority: Medium)
   - Optimistic updates for feedback actions
   - Error boundaries for page-level failures
   - Loading states during mutations
   - Toast notifications
   - Tracked for Phase 3 polish

---

## Transition to Phase 3

**Phase 3: Briefings & Core UI** (Week 4) will add:

1. **Recommender Agent**: Daily digest generation
   - Noise cap enforcement (10-20 papers max)
   - Target selection from scored papers
   - Exploration strategy (15% default)
   - Material improvement filter (score threshold)

2. **Three-Pane Layout**:
   - Navigation pane (Today, Saved, Archives)
   - Briefing list (paper cards)
   - Detail pane (full paper view)
   - Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Hotkeys for efficient triage (j/k/s/h/c)
   - Help modal with shortcuts guide
   - Focus management

4. **Scheduled Digest Generation**:
   - pg-boss cron job (daily at 6:30 AM)
   - Parallel generation for all users
   - Status tracking (generating/ready/viewed)

5. **Settings UI Consolidation**:
   - Tabbed interface (Sources, Categories, Personalization, Preferences, Models)
   - Digest preferences (enabled, noise cap, threshold)
   - AI model selection (local vs cloud)

**Blocked By**: None - Phase 2 complete, ready to proceed

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully delivered a sophisticated personalization and ranking engine. The multi-signal scoring algorithm produces relevance-ranked paper feeds, personalization rules enable fine-grained control, and continuous feedback-driven learning ensures the system improves over time.

**Code Quality**: 221 total tests passing, TypeScript strict mode passing, all linting checks passing, production build succeeding.

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 3 (Briefings & Core UI) to deliver the **MVP milestone** - complete end-to-end user experience with daily personalized briefings.
